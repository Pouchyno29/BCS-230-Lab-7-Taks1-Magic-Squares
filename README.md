   *********** Magic Squares ************* 
   
   
One interesting application of two-dimensional arrays is    
magic squares. A magic square is a square matrix in    
which the sum of every row, every column, and both    
diagonals is the same. Magic squares have been    
studied for many years, and there are some    
particularly famous magic squares.

                 
In this exercise you will modify the provided shell code    
to determine whether a square is magic or not assuming    
that all elements are between 1 and 9.
Your program should simulate a magic square using    
two-dimensional 3x3 array. It should have a Boolean    
function isMagicSquare that accepts the array as an argument    
and returns true if it is determines it is a Magic square and    
false if it is not.
